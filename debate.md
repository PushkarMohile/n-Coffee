## Debating

I am an international award winning competitive debater, having reached the Octofinals of the Australasian Intervarsity Debating Championship 2020 and being the top breaking Indian team at the Asian British Parliamentary Championship 2020. I find that debating is an excellent platform to explore the complex interplay of the individual human experience and society at large. Some of my speeches can be found on YouTube
