I am a PhD Student at Stony Brook University in the Dept of Physics.  I am currently interested in Statistical Mechanics and Condensed Matter physics. Right now, I am working on Measurement Induced Phase Transitions.    

I have also been a competitive debater at the intervarsity level, part of some of India's best performing team at several international tournaments. Some of my recorded debates can be found [here](debate.md).
