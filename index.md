I am a student of Engineering Physics at the Indian Institute of Bombay, currently in my third year of undergraduate studies. I am interested in studying the connection between mathematical concepts and their use in modeling phenomena in the real world. I am also a competitive debater at the intervarsity level, part of India's best performing team at several international tournaments.

I am interested in understanding the mathematical structures used to explain the most fundamental aspects of our universe. Newer developments in algebra like Category theory give us a powerful language to gain a deeper understanding of algebra and geometry, and I am excited to understand how these abstract formulations clarify our models of reality.
