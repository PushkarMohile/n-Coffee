I am a student of Engineering Physics at the Indian Institute of Bombay, currently in my third year. I am interested in studying the connection between mathematical concepts and their use in modelling phenomenon in the real world.  I am also a competetive debator at the intervarsity level, part of one of the best performing teams from India at several international tournaments.   

I am interested in the understanding the mathematical structures used to explain the most fundamental aspects of our universe. Newer developments in algebra like Category theory give us a powerful language to gain a deeper understanding of algebra and geometry and I am excited to understand how these abstract formulations clarify our models of reality.
