I am a senior undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in the Dept. of Physics. I am interested in studying mathematical structures that arise from problems in physics, with a specific focus on Quantum Field Theory and Integrability. For example, positive geometries from scattering amplitudes or representations of Hopf algebras from the Yang-Baxter equations. Further, I would like to explore applications from the Geometric Langlands program to central problems in quantization and integrability.  

I am currently working on the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for resurgent quantum mechanics, which gives us powerful tools for calculating the spectra of complex ODEs. My focus is on the Schr√∂dinger equation and the Exact WKB method. I am currently also studying algebraic geometry. Previously, I have studied algebraic QFT, and have also pursued representation theory of Lie algebras, differential geometry and manifolds amongst other things in modern mathematics.  

I am also a competitive debater at the intervarsity level, part of India's best performing team at several international tournaments. Some of my recorded debates can be found [here](debate.md).
