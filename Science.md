## Thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, Resurgence Theory, and Integrability (Bachelor's Thesis)

I am currently working on a variant of the Bethe-ansatz called the "Thermodynamic" Bethe-ansatz, a historically famous technique for generating exact solutions to quantum integrable systems. Several profound correspondences involving the Bethe-Ansatz have been found in the last couple decades, involving correspondences to supersymmetric gauge theories (called the "Bethe/Gauge") correspondence and to complex ODEs (The ODE/IM correspondence). This has been formulated by [Marino, Ito, and Shu](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04812) using the methods of Resurgence theory for quantum periods for general polynomial potentials. I am working on extending these techniques to potentials where the polynomials are allowed to have discontinuities. We have also developed a novel Bethe-like ansatz for the hydrogen atom. We are especially excited to see whether we can deepen these correspondences to other system by looking for cluster algebras inherent to the system. 

## Causal Perturbation Theory and Epstein-Glaser axioms
One of the attempts to axiomatize QFT is the causal perturbative approach, where the time-ordered product, a central construction in QFT, is axiomatized in a combinatorial fashion corresponding to the Tits product on the $A_n$ type hyperplane arrangement. These constraints come from the causality requirements for the theory. I have been very interested in exploring whether similar structures can be found when the causality conditions are weakened by an analytic continuation of the time coordinate, corresponding to a statistical field theory. I am also interested in the connections Feynman integrals have to multiple zeta values in QFT.  

## Integrable Systems, Solitons and Quantization
Solitons find use in modeling nonperturbative phenomena in field theories, such as the Goldstone boson. Solitons are linked to integrable systems such as the K-dV equation and Toda Lattices. In this project I explored the link between the Lax formalism's Lie algebra structure and the Poisson manifold structure in the hamiltonian formalism. The quantization of the KdV bihamiltonian gives us interesting structures like the Virasoro and the Current algebra used in 2-D CFTs. This correspondence seems to happen at the level of representation theory with results like the Sugawara construction. These structures therefore seem to relate several different fields and are very exciting.

## Bimonoids for hyperplane arrangements
A species is a  functor category from algebraic structures on hyperplane arrangements(The Tits and Birkhoff monoids) to vector spaces. It is possible to define bialgebra like structures called bimonoids on this category whose structure theory mirrors that of lie algebras and lie groups, from the relations like the exponential - log correspondence and the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem. The study of these structures also provides insight into certain combinatorial structures like shuffles and permutations related to the Braid group. Further, as the Tits and Birkhoff monoids have a nice representation theory, they are fascinating and intuitive to study.

## Ecological Modelling
Population models have been studied for a long time now. There has been some interest in modeling population dynamics through stochastic models instead of deterministic ones. I have spent some time exploring the differences that these models have, especially near extinction, where the behavior differs the most. These stochastic models seem to be closer to experimental results in cases like the cyclic dominance of E-Coli. My simulations on MATLAB seem to indicate that persistent deterministic models are guaranteed to show extinction in stochastic models, albeit at large timescales.
