# Interests and Previous Projects 
I am interested in studying the mathematical models and methods used in particle physics and unifying models like string theory and quantum models for gravity, especially the algebraic 
structures and dynamical systems involved.  

## Integrable Systems, Solitons and Quantization  
Solitons find use in modelling non perturbative structures in field theories, such as the Goldstone Boson as a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Solitons are also
linked to integrable systems such as the K-dV equation and Toda Lattices. I am currently exploring the link between the algebraic structures of the Lax formalism which takes the 
form of a Lie algebra and the Hamiltonian formalism which takes the form of a poisson manifold. The quantization of the KdV bihamiltonian gives us interesting structures like 
Virasoro and the Current algebra which finds use in 2-D CFTs. These structures therefore seem to relate to several different fields and are very exciting. 

## Bimonoids for hyperplane arrangements 
A species is a functor category from certain algebraic structures on hyperplane arrangements(The Tits and Birkhoff monoids) to vector spaces. It is possible to define bi-algebra like structures called bimonoids 
on this category whose structure theory mirrors that of lie algebras and lie groups, from the relations like the exponential - log correspondence and the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem. 
The study of these structures also provides a lot of insight into certain combinatorial structures like shuffles and permutations which are related to the Braid group, and have recently been used to study [pQFTs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09969.pdf)
Further as the Tits and Birkhoff monoids have a nice representation these structures are very interesting. 

## Ecological Modelling 
Population models have been studied for a long time now. There has been some interest in recent times in modelling population dynamics through stochastic models instead of deterministic 
ones. I have spent some time exploring the differences that these models have especially near extinction, where the behaivour differs the most. These stochastic models seem to be closer 
to experimental results in cases like the cyclic dominance of E-Coli My simulations on MATLAB seem to indicate that persistent deterministic models are guarenteed to show extinction in stochastic models , albeit at very large timescales.
